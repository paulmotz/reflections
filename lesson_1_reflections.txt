How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Seeing different versions of the file helped pinpoint exactly where the error was.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If something from a previous version is desired, it can be retrieved easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Commits can be of varying size and for a logical purpose rather than a space/time allocation.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It is very possible that multiple files depend on each other (ie HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Log shows all commits and shows info such as comments and date. Diff shows differences between two commits. It is invoked by typing "diff before after"

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always revert to the prevous version if something breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Any projects I am working on.
