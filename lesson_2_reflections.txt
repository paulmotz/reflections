What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A (hidden) .git file is added. This is needed to enable git/commits. Otherwise it is just any other directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It contains the files that will be part of the next commit. This allows for users to commit only certain files.
